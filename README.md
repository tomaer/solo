## Introduction

[Solo](https://github.com/b3log/solo) is a Java open-source blogging system that can be set up with **one command** and has 15+ sets of elaborate skins.

The first version of Solo was released in 2010 and has been very mature so far. Please feel free to use :smirk_cat:

## Installation

After the JDK environment is ready, [download](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1dzk7SU) the latest Solo package decompression and enter the decompression directory to execute:

* Windows: `java -cp "WEB-INF/lib/*;WEB-INF/classes" org.b3log.solo.Starter`
* Unix-like: `java -cp "WEB-INF/lib/*:WEB-INF/classes" org.b3log.solo.Starter`

`docker volume create solo_datas && docker run --privileged --name solo --restart=unless-stopped -p 8080:8080 -v solo_datas:/opt/b3log/backup/ -d 88250/solo`

Recommend using mysql, if you used h2, database will auto save in docker volume, you can backup plugins & skins same as docker volume, Restore through backup after upgrade  
`docker exec -it solo cp -r /opt/b3log/solo/plugins /opt/b3log/backup/ && docker exec -it solo cp -r /opt/b3log/solo/skins /opt/b3log/backup/`

## Stack

* Backend framework: In order to reduce the memory footprint of the server as much as possible and try some technical [ideas](https://hacpai.com/article/1403847528022) along the way, we have developed the [Latke](https://github.com/b3log/latke) framework and built on this basis [Solo](https://github.com/b3log/solo), [Sym](https://github.com/b3log/symphony), [XiaoV](https://github.com/b3log/xiaov) and other products. These products will in turn put demands on the framework. This is a mutually beneficial and co-evolutionary benign development process
* Frontend framework: In order to reduce the complexity, Solo's front-end part only depends on components such as jQuery, editor, and code highlighting. The SPA framework and skin responsive UI of the management background are all realized by us.

**There is no best wheel, only the most suitable wheel.** BTW, if you want to study how to make web wheels, Solo is a good entry.

In addition, in order to ensure the quality of Solo, we have also made a lot of efforts, including:

* Uniform code style
* Complete javadoc comments
* Strict branch and defect tracking management
* Continuously improved test cases, continuous integration
